    <content>1. Eat lean protein: you want to make sure you go for the leaner cuts of those meats like chicken breast maybe the thighs but leave the drum sticks alone. If you're having ground beef make sure to ask for 5-6% fat ONLY. 2. Try to eat set time: instead of combining your whole day food and eating it at once at the end of the day why not separate your meals at least it help you know how much you're consuming. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. If you're doing your 9-5 and no time to come back home to make your lunch why not make yourself a lunch box! When creating your dream body you need to make some sacrifices! 3. Try to meal prep on Sunday or whatever day good for you: make sure you're not doing takeout regularly. Stop buying processed food and try to cook home this will help you control the amount of calories especially coming from your oil and seasoning. Most of those foods prepared outside are high in calories and low on proteins 4. Alcohol and sugary beverages: alcohol on the regular is bad for your system less to talk about how it slows down your metabolism. It's true almost all of our foods possess lab sugar but also topping it up with pure full sugar food won't help you lose that stubborn tummy, bat wing /arm fat , or back fat. Let go of these for now 5. have good sleep: in as much this may sound simple it really be the cause you're not dropping off that dead weight. If you don't get enough rest, you're tired and when you're tired you're More likely to eat more. Tiredness actually increases a chemical in your system called ghrelin and that upregulates which mean you're more hungry when you're tired. Try to manage your stress level so you can have a sound deep sleep Join my community ⬆️⬆️  first link in my bio 🔗🔗 structure meal plan  #lamdmineworkout #landminelegandglute #legday #singlelegrdl #glutegrowth ##landminesquat #foryoupage #viral #caloriedeficittoloseweight </content>
