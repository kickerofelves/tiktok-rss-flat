    <content>Your girl is finally  @Legion Athletics  athlete 📣 Use code: KORPO to save up to 15% off Legion is the #1 all-natural sports supplements in the world! All supplements are 100% natural with zero artificial sweeteners, flavors and dye. I love this brand because they cares to know that prop blends are bad for your health now and long term. Coming from someone who easily have breakout and hormonal imbalances from most supplements I have tried! Way before this partnership came long I started using legion supplements like the protein, pre-workout and post-workout to surprise I have yet to face these issues. 1. Legion Whey protein: if you’re someone who struggle to get your protein in from daily food , I highly recommend using legion protein. Bestie, you don’t have to worry about being bloated because it’s all natural sweetened and flavored. Of course zero added sugar 2. PULSE pre-workout : my favorite flavor “ fruit punch “ if you find yourself low on energy before or after the gym you need this one. If you’re easily fatigued during your workout, struggle with endurance, and strength. This has helps me  RECHARGE post-workout: my favorite flavor “ strawberry lemonade “ this one has me maintain my gains especially on my rest days or having busy days during the week and can’t make it to the gym. Boost growth and recovery it has 5gram of micronized creatine monohydrate. I take this right after after my workout   PHOENIX fat burner : this one is for my bestie on the weight journey you need this now. FORGE helps with fat loss by speeding up your metabolism and increases energy   #legion #fyp </content>
