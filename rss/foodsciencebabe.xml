    <content>Botulism toxin can be present in canned vegetables without any changes in color, smell or texture of the food. Also, foodborne bacteria and their spores are more sensitive to wet heat than dry heat. They will die in hot dry air much slower than in hot water, which makes dry canning especially dangerous. Canning recommendations from USDA are research-based to ensure that your canned goods remain safe. The process for canning low-acid foods must be followed exactly as written, including: how to select and prepare the food, what liquid to use and how to fill the jars, how to do the step-by-step canning process in a recommended pressure canner, and how to make altitude adjustments. The liquid used to fill the jars is necessary so that the heat from the canning process penetrates throughout the jars as expected during processing. Similarly, the liquid used to can high-acid foods like fruits is also important to their safety, so that heat penetration occurs as expected during processing, and to kill germs of concern in fruits or other high-acid foods. Canning for food preservation is not designed to be a creative activity that only aims to produce the best quality of food. Safety must come first, and the processes and recipes from USDA require you to use specific liquids in the jars to safely can your foods, including vegetables. #foodsafety #foodie #foodtok #canning #notaconspiracy </content>
