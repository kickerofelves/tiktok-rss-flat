    <content>Replying to @Josh Williams  While allergen advisory statements are often used, consumers should be aware that these statements are voluntary and there is no uniform rule that governs what they mean. Thus, a “produced in a facility” statement is not necessarily different from a “may contain” statement with regards to whether allergen cross-contact is more likely, or allergen presence is higher and poses greater risk. #greatvalue #foodsafety #foodallergy #foodscience </content>

    <content>Replying to @J G   high moisture, soft, porous foods can be contaminated below the surface, and may have harmful bacteria growing along with the mold, so best to discard if any part has mold. Mold on lower moisture, firm fruits and veggies, hard cheeses, hard salami and dry cured country hams can be cut at least 1 inch around and below the mold spot. Be sure not to touch the knife to the mold. #foodsafety #moldyfood #microbiology #foodscience #greenscreen </content>
