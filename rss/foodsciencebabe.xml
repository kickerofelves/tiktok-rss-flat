In dangerous molds, poisonous substances are often contained in and around these threads. In some cases, toxins may have spread throughout the food.

    <content>Replying to @J G   high moisture, soft, porous foods can be contaminated below the surface, and may have harmful bacteria growing along with the mold, so best to discard if any part has mold. Mold on lower moisture, firm fruits and veggies, hard cheeses, hard salami and dry cured country hams can be cut at least 1 inch around and below the mold spot. Be sure not to touch the knife to the mold. #foodsafety #moldyfood #microbiology #foodscience #greenscreen </content>

    <content>#stitch with @Ashley Freeman, M.S.  If we aren’t acknowledging things like socio economic factors as well as social and structural determinants of health, then we aren’t going to solve any real issues. In the same regard, disregarding the laws of thermodynamics because a calories in/calories out calculation isn’t an effective or helpful tool for everyone isn’t going to help us work towards any real solutions either. #thermodynamics #healthtok #caloriesincaloriesout #socialdeterminantsofhealth #fitnesstok </content>
