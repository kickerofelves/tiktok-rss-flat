    <content>#zinuspartner  Change is my thing, especially when it comes to my space.  I remember when Aris and I first moved into our first home 3years ago from newly college graduate to  purchasing our first set of budgeted home furniture. We were so excited about our journey as a unit and looking back today, it brings me so much joy to do it over and over again with him. With our families visiting for the holidays this year I couldn’t wait to re-decorate and set up the Christmas tree early this year.  @ZINUS</content>
