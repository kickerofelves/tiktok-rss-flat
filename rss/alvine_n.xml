    <content>Replying to @😶‍🌫️Queens is the king Happy Sunday! Just finished meal prepping for the next 3 days. 💃 My cookbook Hourglass Culinary Curves launches this Thursday, November 9th, featuring all my favorite delicious recipes that helped me lose weight and build muscle.  Here’s my plan for the week: For breakfast, I’ll have protein oats. Since I go to the gym at 2:30 PM, I’ll enjoy a rice cake with peanut butter and fruit (watermelon &amp; pineapple) afterwards.  Post-gym, I’ll refuel with a good protein shake.  Then, at 7 PM, I’ll have 400g of grilled chicken breast from the air fryer, paired with salad—I like my protein fresh, so I season it and keep it in the fridge at the beginning of the week. I prefer a low-carb diet initially, then starting Thursday, I’ll introduce pasta, sweet potatoes, &amp; rice. Stay tuned for dinner recipes coming soon. Have questions? Leave them in the comments! All my workouts and nutrition tips are available in my bio  Don’t forget to join my private community group chat for daily support and motivation.</content>

    <content>#CapCut We never skip a core workout! 🔥 Remember, genetics play a role in your skin's response to weight loss. Here's my strategy: * Lose weight gradually to give your skin time to adjust—aim for 1-2 pounds a week. * Combine strength training with LISS cardio to build muscle and reduce the appearance of loose skin. * Stay hydrated. Water is key for skin elasticity. * Follow a balanced diet rich in protein and essential vitamins like C, D, calcium, magnesium, omega-3, and probiotics. * Care for your skin with regular exfoliation to boost blood flow and moisturizing to improve elasticity. I use bio-oil after my shower to help with stretch marks and skin elasticity. Be patient with the process. If you have questions, drop them in the comments. Ready to train with me? Check out my workout program, nutrition guide, and private community group chat in my bio. Let's get stronger together! 💪#weightloss </content>
