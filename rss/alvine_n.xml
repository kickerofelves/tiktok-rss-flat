    <content>60%off my cookbook in bio ‚ù§Ô∏è Here's my strategy: * Lose weight gradually to give your skin time to adjust‚Äîaim for 1-2 pounds a week. * Combine strength training with LISS cardio to build muscle and reduce the appearance of loose skin. * Stay hydrated. Water is key for skin elasticity. * Follow a balanced diet rich in protein and essential vitamins like C, D, calcium, magnesium, omega-3, and probiotics. * Care for your skin with regular exfoliation to boost blood flow and moisturizing to improve elasticity. I use bio-oil after my shower to help with stretch marks and skin elasticity. Be patient with the process. If you have questions, drop them in the comments. Ready to train with me? Check out my workout program, nutrition guide, and private community group chat in my bio. Let's get stronger together! üí™#mealprep #healthy </content>

    <content>From my first shaky steps to losing 128 pounds, I‚Äôve transformed not just in body, but in spirit. When I embarked on this journey, little did I know that one day, my story would be an open book to the world. I was camera-shy and unsure, which is why early pictures are rare, but my early followers on TikTok have witnessed the real, unfiltered evolution. The path wasn‚Äôt straight; I stumbled, made mistakes, and learned as I shed 117 pounds in the first 11 months, and continued to evolve over the next two years. Here's the truth: the journey is as personal as it is universal. If you're standing at the starting line, unsure and overwhelmed, remember that I was once there, too. I am the evidence that it's possible, and I'm here to share every tip and trick that made a difference in my weight loss. Let's embark on this path together because your transformation is waiting, and I'm here to help you embrace it.#weightloss #weightlosstransformation #weightlosscheck </content>
